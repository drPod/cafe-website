Our Cold Brew Coffee is made with a selection of coffee beans from the Monteverde area. This coffee blend made by our certified taster is a mix of roasts and special coffee processes to achieve balanced notes on the palate. Delicate notes of cocoa and vanilla, high body and low acidity of nuts. Ideal to take it alone or with milk #coffee #coffeetime #coldbrewcoffee #monteverde #bosquenuboso #cqi #barista #baristalife #baristalifestyle #espresso
